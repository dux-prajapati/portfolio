## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Python 3 (for local development server)

### Local Development

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Direct File Access

You can also open `index.html` directly in your browser, but using a local server is recommended for the best experience and to avoid CORS issues.

## 📝 Personal Notes & Customization

### Future Enhancements

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Colors
The main color scheme uses CSS custom properties. Update these in the `:root` section of `style.css`:

:root {
  --primary-color: #667eea;
  --secondary-color: #764ba2;
  --text-color: #333;

}
```

- Adjust animation durations

- Add new animation effects

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Sections

2. Create corresponding styles in `css/style.css`
3. Add JavaScript functionality in `js/main.js`

### Performance Tips
